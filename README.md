## Project Questions

1. **Which are the top five assignments based on the total value of donations, categorized by donor type?**  
   - Output should include: `assignment_name`, `region`, `rounded_total_donation_amount` (rounded to two decimal places), and `donor_type`.  
   - Results should be sorted by total donation amount in descending order.

2. **What is the assignment with the highest impact score in each region, considering only those assignments that received at least one donation?**  
   - Output should include: `assignment_name`, `region`, `impact_score`, and `num_total_donations`.  
   - Return only one assignment per region, sorted by region in ascending order.

## Project Goals

- Analyze donation trends and donor behaviors over time.
- Evaluate assignment effectiveness based on impact scores and funding.
- Identify key donors and regions with significant contributions or results.
- Create visualizations and reports to support strategic decision-making.
